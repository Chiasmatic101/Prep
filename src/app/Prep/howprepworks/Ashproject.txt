Learning Abilities differ from person to person 

But did you know that every person has a natural learning cycle 

For early birds this cycle peaks during school hours - which is great

but for others 'Night Owls' peak learning times occur when school is over 

So some students have a natural disadvantage 


With PREP 

We measure your learning abilities with regular validated cognitive games - that feel like fun ones

We suggest changes to your sleep, diet and activity to modify your circadian rhytms so they peak during key learning and study periods

KNwoing when your learning is at peak helps you optimize your students learning and improve overall grades. 


Sleep Optimization 

Imrpove Sleep Quality 
Reduce Go to sleep time
Reduce Waking events 

Challenge other students to sleep and cognition challenges.

App - Game 

2 to 3 weeks - 


Formula 1 - Formula E ( I want you to watch races and know the teams and drivers names) 
Prep - Academic Tests Vs Prep 


Marketing 
Understand the message



Validate Games 
Look up - what are cognitive tests?
What are commom tests 
I have assigned you a set of tests - sit down take them and read the reports


I want you to investigate the effects of chrontype on cognition 

Validate our trials and games against Cognifity = so ten minutes of cognifit + 10 minutes of games - Determine relationships

A mini experiemtn to determine how Chronotype effects cognitive domains in high school students

Recruits 13 to 24 year olds (Middle, High SChool and College (undergrads) 

I want you to interview them - go on zoom - determine their chronotype 

Create an interview that understands their chrontype and

Use our site to determine their chrontype and their schedule 

Track, Activity, go to sleep time, wake time and diet for 7 days 

RESULTS

Compare chrontype to schedule 

Do they like the games - would they play again 







Chrontype Questionaire

How it works section on site 

Understand the problem 

Take Chrontype questionnaire - determine type 

3 times a day - do cognifit + Prep tests (10 munute) each 

Track their activity, meals and go to sleep times, wake times? App or website

Mood game Vs mood questions?? Ask Poorni how to validate it - algorithms to use


So main points"
1. Understand cog tests 
2. Understand relationship between cognition and sleep 
3. Understand relationship between jet lag and cognition
4. Understand chrontypes and how they relate to jet lag 
5. Recruit 10 volunteers forstudy
6. Zoom call with each volunteer - take Cognifit tests, Play Games, ( 3 times a day) - track schedule, activity, diet and sleep times 
7. Look at scores Vs Chrontype 
8. Modify Lifestyle (Pick most likely element) ask volunteer to make change
9. Repear Cog Tests
10. Determine if there was an effect
11. Validate Games against Cog Tests

Business. 
Recruit users - get them to also recruit users - we want to recruit base users and sales people 







Finish app - how it works



Create signup site 


Before launch we need to recruit 100 leaders and 10 preps so 1000 all together pre-registered - each of the preps can join once they also signup 5 to 10 people - commission activates once 5 people have signed up - higher commission after 10 people higher after 100 people 







SALES AND MARKETING 


Final interview - WE are developing an app that will help you improve your grades to help determine your chronotype
As part of that we are recruiting young leaders to sell the game to their peers (and their peers parents) for a commission 

If we offered you 15% of monthly profit to recruit users - how many do you think you could recruit 

Could they recruit ten or more users?

15% of monthly contract 
20% for annual contract 

For instance the app will cost $14.99 per month - if you recruit 5 users (min amount) (they sign a one year contract) then you will get $9.95 per month 

15% of 14.99 = $2.25

if you recruit 20 users you will received ( $40 per month) - 100 users is ($225 per month) or $2700 per year 
Commission Contracts last one year from 

With a min of 10 users before contract initiates

Validate Cog Tests 







Determine their schedule- What domains are most predominante during school time at what time of day 

For instance - History in the morning ( required what domains) - study sessions when 

DEtermine if their cog type differs from

Split each into a separate section 
With image on one side and then text on the other - add fun imagery or placeholders - with clocks and daylight / nighttime imagery
